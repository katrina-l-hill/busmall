## Project Scope

This project was created to provide a selection of product photos to a user so they can pick their favorites. These products are travel related and designed to make one's life easier. 

## How it Works
The user will see a selection of photos for which they can click on only one. After clicking on one, a new set of three random photos will appear. They will click on one photo in each set for a total of 25 rounds. 

After the 25 rounds is over a bar table and pie chart will appear below the photos to show them how many times each photo was clicked and viewed.

## Inside the Code

The code was designed to allow you to only see the same photo once in the current and previous set. This assures that you get shown different photos each time. You will notice that the website remembers you selections and results even if you refresh or reset the browser.
